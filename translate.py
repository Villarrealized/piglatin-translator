# Pig Latin Translator

# ******************************************************************************
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The tests in test_translate_word.py & test_translate.py
# are meant to help you as you develop your translator and to validate your
# translator to make sure it correctly translates English in to Pig Latin.
#
# Start by running the tests in test_translate_word.py.
# Once all the tests in that file pass, then also start testing
# your translator against the tests in test_translate.py
#
# Running the tests is very simple. In a terminal, type:
#
# python3 test_translate_word.py
#
# There are a lot of tests, and they will all run when running the above code.
# Feel free to comment out tests that you don't want to run
# or alternatively, you can run tests individually by specifying the class
# name followed by the test name like so:
#
# python3 test_translate_word.py TestTranslateWord.test_consonant_rule_titlecase
